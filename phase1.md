# Phase 1: Foundation Model Development

**Duration**: June - October 2025  
**Objective**: Develop self-supervised learning approaches for pathology foundation models

## MSK-SLCPFM Dataset

The Phase 1 dataset provides participants with unprecedented access to the MSK-SLCPFM collection - the largest pathology dataset ever assembled for competition purposes.

### Dataset Specifications
- **Scale**: ~300 million pathology image tiles
- **Source**: 51,578 whole slide images (WSIs)  
- **Coverage**: 39 cancer types
- **Origins**: TCGA, CPTAC, and MSK repositories
- **Scanner Diversity**: Multiple vendors (Aperio, Hamamatsu, Leica, Parmana, Phillips)

### Data Composition

| Source | Number of WSIs |
|--------|----------------|
| TCGA | 10,438 |
| CPTAC | 6,004 |
| MSK | 34,690 |
| **Total** | **51,132** |

## Multi-Resolution Tile Formats

To capture multi-scale tissue contexts essential for pathological analysis, the dataset includes three distinct tile formats:

1. **224 Ã— 224 pixel tiles** from 20Ã— WSIs (0.5Î¼mÂ²/pixel)
2. **448 Ã— 448 pixel tiles** from 40Ã— WSIs (0.25Î¼mÂ²/pixel)  
3. **1024 Ã— 1024 pixel tiles** from 20Ã— WSIs with independent coordinates

This strategic sampling approach facilitates hierarchical tissue structure learning across varying magnifications, mimicking the multi-resolution examination methodology employed by pathologists.

## Complete Cancer Types Distribution

The dataset spans all 39 cancer types with the following distribution:

3. **Documentation**: Detailed guides on dataset structure and submission requirements
4. **Submission Resources**: Templates for inference code (Python) and algorithm descriptions (LaTeX)

## Unique Challenges of Pathology Data

The MSK-SLCPFM dataset presents unique challenges compared to natural image datasets:

### Limited Color Variation
- H&E staining constrains colors to blue-purple (nuclei) and pink (cytoplasm/matrix)
- Different from rich color variation in natural images

### Rotational Invariance
- Microscopic structures (nuclei, cells, glands) appear in arbitrary orientations
- No canonical orientation unlike objects in natural images

### Non-IID Samples
- Tiles from same WSI are not completely independent samples
- Contrasts with ImageNet where images are Independent and Identically Distributed

### Multi-Resolution Context
- Tissue details vary significantly across magnifications
- Glands appear larger with more cellular details at 40Ã— vs 20Ã— resolution
- Important pathological features may only be visible at specific magnifications


## Data Ethics and Privacy

- All competition data has been de-identified
- Approved for research use under respective institutional IRB protocols
- Complies with HIPAA regulations
- Usage restricted to non-commercial academic research
- No patient overlap between Phase 1 and Phase 2 datasets
