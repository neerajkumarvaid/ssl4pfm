## üîß Technical Questions

### Q1: Are participants permitted to fine-tune existing foundation models, or must models be trained entirely from scratch?

**Answer:** Participants are permitted to use publicly available pathology foundation models as starting points for their submissions. However, only foundation models that are publicly accessible and documented in [this foundation models list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tlbI5clx74IGOyAcoFQGr10YZ1NSMEzT_INAQzoGvxs/edit?usp=sharing) may be utilized. 

**Important restrictions:**
- Private or proprietary pathology foundation models are strictly prohibited
- Models trained on internal institutional datasets cannot be used
- Only models with public access and documentation are acceptable

### Q2: Can existing foundation models (e.g., UNI, PLIP) be incorporated as guidance during the pre-training phase?

**Answer:** Yes, participants may leverage publicly available foundation models to inform or assist portions of their self-supervised learning methodology, provided the following conditions are met:

- The foundation models must be publicly accessible
- Models must be included in [this foundation models list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tlbI5clx74IGOyAcoFQGr10YZ1NSMEzT_INAQzoGvxs/edit?usp=sharing)
- Proper attribution and methodology description must be provided in the submission documentation

### Q3: Are participants allowed to incorporate additional information derived from the competition images using external models?

**Answer:** Yes, participants may generate supplementary information from the competition dataset using publicly available models, subject to the following guidelines:

**Permitted approaches:**
- Image descriptions generated by public large language models (LLMs)
- Feature extraction using publicly available vision models
- Metadata generation using open-source tools

**Requirements:**
- All models used for information generation must be publicly available
- Proper citation and attribution required in submission documentation
- Generated information must be derived solely from the competition dataset

**Restrictions:**
- External or private datasets cannot be used to enhance generative models
- Proprietary models trained on private pathology data are prohibited

### Q4: Can participants access de-identified whole slide images (WSIs) to obtain spatial location information?

**Answer:** No, raw whole slide images cannot be provided due to institutional data governance policies. The competition dataset consists exclusively of pre-processed image patches extracted from whole slide images.

**Available data format:**
- Pre-cropped pathology image tiles
- Standardized resolution and format
- No spatial coordinate information included

**Rationale:** This limitation ensures compliance with institutional review board requirements and patient privacy protections while maintaining dataset consistency across all participants.

## üìã Dataset and Usage Policies

### Q5: What external data sources are permitted for this competition?

**Answer:** Participants must use only the provided competition dataset for model training and validation. External pathology datasets, whether public or private, are strictly prohibited to ensure fair comparison across all submissions.

**Permitted external resources:**
- Publicly available pre-trained models (from the available list)
- Open-source software libraries and frameworks
- Public generative models for information extraction from competition data

### Q6: Are there restrictions on computational resources or training time?

**Answer:** While there are no explicit limits on computational resources for model training, submitted models must meet the specified inference requirements:

- Single GPU deployment capability
- Maximum 80GB GPU memory usage during inference
- Efficient feature extraction for downstream evaluation

## üìù Submission Requirements

### Q8: What documentation is required for foundation model submissions?

**Answer:** Each submission must include comprehensive technical documentation covering:

- **Methodology description**: Detailed explanation of self-supervised learning approach
- **Architecture specifications**: Model design and implementation details
- **Training procedures**: Hyperparameters, computational requirements, training duration
- **External resource attribution**: Proper citation of any publicly available models or tools used
- **Performance validation**: Any internal evaluation or ablation studies conducted
